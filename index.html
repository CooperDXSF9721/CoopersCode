    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>My main sport is squash. I have been playing it for around six years and I still love it. I play squash all year because it's indoors and regularly play in tournaments. I have training almost seven days a week and don't really have a time in the year when I stop playing. I also like soccer. I played club soccer for the past couple years but quit this year to focus on squash. Either way, I still love soccer just as much as squash and hope to be able to play again. For school, The sports I will do are Soccer, Squash, and Track & Field. These are the same ones as in my sixth grade year and I really enjoyed them so I'm doing them again.</p>
